Because I haven't been blogging at this time, I try to remember what happened in this week.
April 22 I got the email from Google that I will be participating in GSOC16, right after this I wrote
email to my mentors (Sergei V. Gleyzer and Enric Tejedor). Sergei said I should take a look at TMVAGui, we also
discussed that we will use JSROOT. We fixed the first kick-off meeting to May 3.

In this week I worked 4 days. I wrote a JavaScript class that read a TMVA output file and is able to reproduce some functionality
of TMVAGui. I worked a lot with this, because I misunderstand the goal of JsROOT, I manipulated it in JavaScript. Although
this was a good start and I learnt a lot about how JsROOT works, maybe we will profit form this latter.

Here is the JavaScrit module that I wrote:

{:.scrollbar style="height:500px"}{% highlight JavaScript %}
{% include posts/gsoc16/TMVAGui.js %}
{% endhighlight %}

The code above will result this (maybe you have to wait a little to appear because the TMVA.root file is big):

{% include posts/gsoc16/week1_result.html %}
