This week I moved from old [repository](https://github.com/qati/JIMVA) to new [GSOC](https://github.com/qati/GSOC16) repository.

This project won't have c++ library for now. JPyInterface register now a IPython magic `%jsmva on` will call the function register methods. This methods will inject the drawing methods to DataLoader and Factory.


## Correlation matrix
The data loader method for correlation matrix moved to
{% highlight c++ %}
TH2* TMVA::DataLoader::GetCorrelationMatrix(const TString& className);
{% endhighlight %}

This method will return a histogram object containing the correlation matrix. I forked the root project I added this new method, and created my first pull request. The JPyInterface module now will use this method, to get histogram form DataLoder and then will use the `ROOT::TBufferJSON::ConvertToJSON` function to convert to JSON string.

To create correlation matrix plot we need to call the following method:
{% highlight python %}
loader.DrawCorrelationMatrix(className) # className: "Signal" or "Background"
{% endhighlight %}

Calling this method will result's the following plot:

{% include posts/gsoc16/jsdraw.html part="1" file="correlation_matrix" method="drawTH2" %}


## ROC curve
I also added drawing method for ROC curve. Factory already has method which generates the histogram, I just call this method, and do the same stuff as for correlation matrix.

{% include posts/gsoc16/jsdraw.html part="1" file="roc_curve" method="draw" %}

## Input variables
I created a new method to DataLoder:
{% highlight c++ %}
TH1F* TMVA::DataLoader::GetInputVariableHist(const TString& className, const TString& variableName, UInt_t numBin, const TString& processTrfs="");
{% endhighlight %}
This method will return input variable histogram for selected variable and selected class(Signal/Background), also can perform  transformations on variables (this transformations will not be saved, just used to create histogram).

### No transformation

* Code:
{% highlight python %}
loader.DrawInputVariable("var0") #first parameter is the variable name, now "var0"
{% endhighlight %}

* Result:

{% include posts/gsoc16/jsdraw.html part="1" file="input_variables" method="draw" %}


### Transformed input

* Code:

{% highlight python %}
loader.DrawInputVariable("var0", processTrfs="D") # processTrfs can be: I;N;D;P;U;G,D
{% endhighlight %}

* Result:

{% include posts/gsoc16/jsdraw.html part="1" file="input_variables_transformed" method="draw" %}
