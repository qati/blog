I was selected to Google Summer of Code 2016 program. My organization will be the CERN SFT and I will work on ROOT::TMVA framework, which is a  machine learning framework commonly used in particle physics. My project is `Integrating machine learning in Jupyter notebooks`. I will use this blog to post about my work in this summer.
