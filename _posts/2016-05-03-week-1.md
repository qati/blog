Hello!

Because I haven't been blogging at this time, I try to remember what happened in this week.
April 22 I got the email from Google that I will be participating in GSOC16, right after this I wrote
email to my mentors (Sergei V. Gleyzer and Enric Tejedor). Sergei said I should take a look at TMVAGui, we also
discussed that we will use JSROOT. We fixed the first kick-off meeting to May 3.
In this week I worked 4 days. I wrote a JavaScript class that will read a TMVA output file and will be able to reproduce some functionality
of TMVAGui.
