In this week I learnt about Git and Docker. I created a [repository](https://github.com/qati/JIMVA) to my project, and I created a Docker file to binder.

This week was a big iteration from old not to nice interface to a more nice one, I hided my JPyInterface module, we don't have to call init function anymore. In this week I had a lot of error debugging, I don't remember anything else about this week (@June 7).
