In the first 1.5 day of this week I created this blog.


I decided I will use Jekyll and github pages to post about my work. First I learnt how this works, then I had some error with URL at github, now this is solved. I added sharing in email option to my page, because if I want to share a new post mostly I will do in email. I also added support for scrollbar in code highlight and fixing the size of these boxes.
In my work all my outputs are JavaScript based plots, which easily can be used outside of notebook too. So I thought it would be nice, if in my blog I'm able to show my result. To be able to do this, first I created a python module: SavaJSON. If we import this module, it will change the JPyInterface.JsDraw.Draw method to it's own, which is similar to JPyInterface's method, but will save the JSON string. Also contains a method which will save the string to file. In this simple way I save all my plots, I copy to my blog direcotry. I also wrote a blogJsMVA class in JavaScript which will use the JsMVA to produce plots from JSON. Finally I added a new functionality to my page: calling `{% include jsdraw.html part='1' file='json_name' method='jsmva_drawing_method' %}` will produce the nice plots. You can see example for this in week 4 and week 5.
